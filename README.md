# Pm2.5-Pontianak
# Overview
Air pollution is a significant environmental risk to health. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which can penetrate the respiratory system and lead to various health issues. This project aims to predict PM2.5 levels using machine learning models.

# Model
Fuzzy Time Series Chen

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical PM2.5 levels and various meteorological data. It can be downloaded from [[pm2.5 pontianak dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bZuzyVfuqWK315uepThkepeEB1PK3zto?usp=drive_link)].
